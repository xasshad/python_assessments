Hello!

Welcome to my Python Assessments repository! This is where I showcase my past assessments and schoolworkd related to Python.

# PROGRAM GUIDES:

# Box Calculator
For this task, I had to create a box calculator that will inform users on how many small, medium, and large boxes they need for their items.

The large box can only store 5 items, the medium box can only store 3, while the small box can only store 1 item. There cannot be any decimals.

# Grade Calculator
This is the Grade Calculator that computes the user's project score and exam score that would result in the user's final grade. The final grade has to have a corresponding letter equivalent that the user will see when the program is used.

# Bingo Game
For the third activity, I was asked to make a Bingo game where the useri s given a Bingo card with 10 numbers ranging from 1 to 80. The user essentially becomes the caller in this game, because they have to enter a number within 1-80 until they get all 10 numbers correctly. The program has to give the user an infinite amount of tries until all of their guesses are correct.

When they guess a number correctly, the program will inform them. If their entry is incorrect or if they have entered an invalid number, the program will display an error message telling them to input a valid number. If all of their guesses are correct and all the numbers in the list are removed, the program will then shout "BINGO" and end.
